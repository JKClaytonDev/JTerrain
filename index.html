            <h1> 3D Projection in JavaScript</h1>
            <h3><i>I am not using WebGL's 3D capabilities for this project...</i></h3>
            -instead, I am using a custom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection">3D projection algorithm</a> to render this.
            <br><br><b>What?</b><br>
            3D Projection is giving a computer (with a 2D screen) 3D coordinates (the position of an object, the position of the camera, and the direction of the camera) and then showing on the
            2D screen where that object would be on the camera. 
            <br><br><b>Why?</b><br>
            I think it's important to know about low-level 3D engine code. It gives you respect for the fact that some video game engines can render millions
            of polygons without breaking a sweat. Every single point needs to go through a very complicated projection algorithm (like this one except probably
            a lot more complicated and optimized) before the engine even starts postprocessing or drawing the screen.
            <br><br><b>How?</b><br>
            It requires all the coordinates for every point
            to be read every frame and sorted based on distance. I modified the algorithm to run better on most computers due
            to all the data it's crunching, but it means there is a loss in accuracy and the camera can't look up/down. I've also
            implemented a (sort of) version of shaders to differentiate water and grass.
